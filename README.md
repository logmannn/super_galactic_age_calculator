<h1>What does it do?:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Takes a personâ€™s age in years and converts it into seconds.</li>
  <li>Takes two dates and determines the difference, in seconds, between the two.<br>(This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)</li>
  <li>Returns the amount of days between two dates</li>
  <li>Returns someone who is still alive's age in other planetary years</li>
  <li>Tells you how old you are based on your birthdate</li>
  <li>Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet</li>
  <li>Tells you how many years you have left to live if a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy</li>
</ul>
